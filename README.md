# Stock_analysis
Stock analysis using VBA
## Purpose
The purpose of the project is to analyse the given stock information for the year 2017 and 2018 to understand which stocks are worth investing on with the help of VBA. This is done by first retriving each ticker and then calculating the total volume for each ticker and the yearly return. The code is refactored in a way to increase the time efficiency of analysing the data.
## Analysis
The analysis was performed on the VBA editor using the information given. The data given for 2017 and 2018 years include 
* Ticker Index 
* Date of issue
* Opening price
* Closing price
* Adjusted price
* Highest price
* Lowest price and
* The Volume of the stock
## Results
The results were displayed in the excel sheet. They were formatted to show if there was an increase in the yearly return of the ticker for the year, the cell will be highlighted in green and if there was a decrease the cell will be shaded in red. This helped the client visualize the data better.
